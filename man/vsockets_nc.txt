NAME
       vsockets_nc - vsockets and TCP/IP swiss army knife

SYNOPSIS
       
       vsockets_nc [-c <connect to CID>] [-p <connect port>] 
	               [-l <listen port vsocket>] [-i <listen port ipv4>] 
				   [-t] [-d]
				   [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       vsockets_nc is a simple utility which reads and writes data across net‐
       work connections, using vsockets connection-oriented protocol
	   (VMware sockets for host-guest communication, using the "vmci" device). 
	   It is  designed  to  be  a reliable  "back-end" tool that can be used 
	   directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.  
	   At the same time,  it  is  a  feature-rich
       vsockets network  debugging and exploration tool, 
	   since it can create almost any
       kind of connection you would need and has several interesting  built-in
       capabilities. It is inspired in the "nc" TCP/IP utility and can be
	   used in combination with it.

       In  the  simplest usage, 
	   "vsockets_nc -c <connect to CID>] [-p <connect port>]" creates a 
	   vsockets connection to the given port on the given target host.  
	   Your standard input is then  sent
       to the host, and anything that comes back across the connection is sent
       to your standard output.  This continues indefinitely, until  the  net‐
       work  side  of  the  connection shuts down.  Note that this behavior is
       different from most other applications which shut everything  down  and
       exit after an end-of-file on the standard input.

       vsockets_nc  can also function as a server, by listening for inbound connec‐
       tions on arbitrary ports and then doing the same reading  and  writing.
       With  minor  limitations,  vsockets_nc  doesn't  really  care  if it runs in
       "client" or "server" mode -- it still shovels data back and forth until
       there isn't any more left. In either mode, shutdown can be 
	   forced by Ctrl-C

       "vsockets_nc" can tunnel (forward) connections from 
	   the TCP/IP address familly to the vsockets address familly. This
	   can be very useful to integrate with existing TCP/IP tools,
	   such as nmap, telnet, and so on.

	   "vsockets_nc" can perform basic port scanning for vsockets
	   open ports.

OPTIONS
       -c CID       Remote CID (address) to connect to

       -p port      Remote port to connect to

       -l port      listen mode, for vsocket address family inbound connects, 
                    in local port

       -i port      listen mode, for IPv4 address family inbound connects, 
                    in local port

       -t           tunnel connections
                    connects inbound listen address => remote address

       -n           vsockets port scan mode, performs a port scan over vsockets ports

	   -d		    print verbose debug information to stderr


PORT SCANNING
     It	may be useful to know which ports are open and running services	on a
     target machine.  The -n flag can be used to tell vsockets_nc to 
	 report open ports,rather than initiate a connection.	 
	 For example

	   $ vsockets_nc -c 2 -n
	   VMware vsockets environment properties
	   =======================================
	   VMware vmci address familly=28
	   VMware vmci is present
	   VMware vmci local CID=2
	   VMware Hypervisor host machine detected (CID=2)
	   Scanning vsocket ports for CID=3669014335...
	   -+-host port 4000 open


COPYRIGHT
       vsockets_nc  is  entirely my own creation, although plenty of other code was
       used as examples.  It is freely given away to the Internet community in
       the  hope  that  it  will be useful.
	   The author assumes NO responsibility for how anyone uses it.
       If vsockets_nc makes you rich somehow and you're feeling generous, send me
       some bitcoins.


BUGS
       Efforts  have  been made to have vsockets_nc "do the right thing" in 
	   all its various modes.  
	   If you believe that it is doing the wrong  thing  under
       whatever  circumstances,  please notify me and tell me how you think it
       should behave.  If vsockets_nc is not able to do some  task  you  
	   think  up,   minor  tweaks  to the code will probably fix that.  
	   It provides a basic
       and easily-modified template for writing  other  network  applications,
       and  I  certainly  encourage people to make custom mods and send in any
       improvements they make to it. Continued feedback from the Internet com‐
       munity is always welcome!
